# Hospital Incident Manager
The intention behind this project is twofold: to put my knowledge of app design, planning and development into practice and to create a portfolio.

As I have no GUI development experience at the start of this project, I plan to create a command-line interface (CLI) front end.
However, I intend to create a graphical user interface for this project in future, so I will implement a modular architecture to allow for this and other potential changes.

The rest of this document will serve as a record of my work, complete with diagrams and information.
