# Hospital Incident Manager

The intention behind this project is twofold: to put my knowledge of app design, planning and development into practice and to create a portfolio.

As I have no GUI development experience at the start of this project, I plan to create a command-line interface (CLI) front end.
However, I intend to create a graphical user interface for this project in the future, so I will implement a modular architecture to allow for this and other potential changes.

The rest of this document will serve as a record of my work, complete with diagrams and information.

# System Requirements

In this phase, I used ChatGPT to create an interview from which I could extract the programme requirements based on my intended actions.

## Conversation with the client

- Dr. Ruiz: Hello! Thanks for coming. We’ve been needing something like this for a while. The way we’re currently tracking incidents… well, we’re not, really.
- Me: No problem. I’d be happy to help. Could you tell me what kinds of incidents you need to track?
- Dr. Ruiz: Sure. We have equipment failures — monitors not working, infusion pumps acting up — and also infrastructure issues, like air conditioning failures in operating rooms or water leaks. Then we have IT problems too: system outages, login issues, things like that. And we need to make sure those are addressed quickly.
- Me: Understood. So the idea would be to let hospital staff report these problems as they happen?
- Dr. Ruiz: Exactly. Doctors, nurses, admin staff… anyone should be able to report an incident. We just need a place where they can describe what’s wrong and submit it so it reaches the right team.
- Me: Who would be receiving and handling those reports?
- Dr. Ruiz: Depending on the type of incident, it might go to maintenance, biomedical engineering, or IT. Right now I think just having a shared queue is fine — we’ll sort them internally. Later on we can think about routing by category.
- Me: Makes sense. Would staff need to track the status of their reported incidents?
- Dr. Ruiz: Yes, that’s important. People should be able to see if their issue has been received, if it’s being worked on, if it’s resolved, and so on. It helps avoid confusion and follow-up calls.
- Me: And should the technicians or response teams update the status themselves?
- Dr. Ruiz: Yes. Ideally, whoever is working on an incident can write notes, update the status, and maybe even assign it to someone else on their team if needed.
- Me: How about access levels? Should everyone be able to see everything?
- Dr. Ruiz: No, definitely not. Regular users should only see their own reports. Technicians can see everything in their department. And people like me — managers — should be able to see the full picture across all departments.
- Me: Understood. Would you need reporting features, like seeing stats on the number of incidents or response times?
- Dr. Ruiz: Eventually, yes. For now, just being able to download a list of incidents or filter by date, type, or department would be useful.
- Me: What kind of interface would be easiest for staff to use?
- Dr. Ruiz: I imagine we’ll start small, so a terminal interface or a simple command-line tool is okay for now. But please build it in a way that we can add a proper interface later — maybe web-based or even on tablets — without having to start over.
- Me: Okay. And do you use any existing software for this right now?
- Dr. Ruiz: No, it’s all word of mouth or calls to maintenance. Some departments have spreadsheets. But there’s no central system, and that’s a problem.
- Me: Got it. And just to be clear — would this system handle any patient-related information?
- Dr. Ruiz: No. This is strictly for operational incidents — not clinical events or patient records. Those are handled separately with medical reporting systems.
- Me: That’s good to know. Anything else you’d want to have in the future?
- Dr. Ruiz: Maybe notifications — email or internal alerts when something is urgent or when someone comments on your ticket. But that’s not a must-have yet.
- Me: All right. That’s very helpful. I’ll start from here and design a solution you can grow into.
- Dr. Ruiz: Great. Looking forward to it!

## Requirements extraction

The client's expectations of the product are formalised and specified in the system requirements. They help me to visualise, segment and organise the product's development.

### Functional Requirements

The functionality of a program is determined by its functional requirements, which specify what users can and cannot do.

### Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements affect the underlying characteristics of a program that users probably won't notice. They are more geared towards the development team and the program's overall quality.


| ID   | Category        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Priority |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| NFR1 | Maintainability | The application must be developed in a modular fashion, maintaining the business domain independent from persistence and view so that they can be changed in the future.                                                                            | MUST     |
| NFR2 | Extensibility   | The application must be designed in a way that allows for future functionality.                                                                                                                                                                     | SHOULD   |
| NFR3 | Security        | All users on the program shall be identified through user name and password, and have roles allowing them to access just the information pertaining to their work. As well as this, every action taken by each user must be logged in an audit log. | MUST     |
| NFR4 | Reliability     | The system must log correctly all incidents and carry out every command it is ordered to without fail.                                                                                                                                              | SHOULD   |
| NFR5 | Portability     | The system should run correctly on Windows, macOS and Linux environments.                                                                                                                                                                           | SHOULD   |
| NFR6 | Testability     | The business logic should be testable independently of the user interface and data storage.                                                                                                                                                         | SHOULD   |

### ASRs - Architecture-significant requirements

ASRs are a subset of the aforementioned requirements that directly impact the architecture under development. In other words, they force or strongly suggest certain design decisions.


| ID   | R-ID | Description                                                                                        | Architectural Implication                                                                                                                                            |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ASR1 | FR4  | Users assigned to an incident must be able to add notes, update its status and assign other users. | Requires well-defined control flow and permission handling at the domain level. May influence the design of the use case layer and the access control mechanism.     |
| ASR2 | FR7  | The system must be accessible via a CLI interface.                                                 | Presentation must be decoupled from the business logic to allow interface substitution. This implies the need for a layered or hexagonal architecture.               |
| ASR3 | FR8  | The system must be usable through a GUI in the future.                                             | Reinforces the need for separation between domain and interface logic. The system must be extensible at the presentation layer without affecting core functionality. |
| ASR4 | FR10 | Internal notifications must be sent when urgent incidents arise.                                   | May require the introduction of an event system or a publish-subscribe pattern. This affects both the domain and infrastructure layers.                              |
| ASR5 | NFR1 | Maintainability: the domain logic must remain independent from persistence and presentation.       | Justifies adopting a modular, decoupled architecture (e.g., hexagonal or layered). Enables long-term maintainability and testing.                                    |
| ASR6 | NFR3 | Security: users must only access data relevant to their role.                                      | Requires an authentication and role-based authorization mechanism, enforced across all entry points of the application.                                              |

These ASRs justify the selection of a clean, layered or hexagonal architecture for the project. They highlight the importance of separating concerns across domain, interface, and infrastructure components, and call for flexible, testable, and scalable design patterns from the early stages of development.

# System Views

For the views of the product I'll be developing, I've chosen the 4+1 scheme, which consists on:

1. Logical View:
   - Focuses on the functional requirements of the system: the structure of the domain, key abstractions, and how they relate.
2. Development View:
   - Describes the software’s organization in the development environment, including modules, layers, and packages.
3. Process View:
   - Describes the system’s dynamic behavior, including concurrency, communication between processes, and runtime performance.
4. Physical View:
   - Focuses on the infrastructure, showing how the system is deployed across physical hardware (servers, devices, network).

- Scenarios View:
  - Captures use cases or scenarios that describe typical interactions between users and the system. This view is used to validate the other four.

I'll start with the scenarios view, since it will act as the foundation for all the other views and is more easily obtained from the system requirements.

## Scenarios View

### Diagram
